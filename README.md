# RealEstateListings

### An application that displays houses that meet the end user's requirements.

A list of houses are populated by a text file which includes the address, the number of bedrooms, the square footage, and the number of bathrooms. The graphical interface consists of text fields where the user enters their requirements for a house. Once the user clicks on the 'Find My Dream House' button, a house that meets their requirements will be displayed. 


If the user doesn't want the displayed house, they can then click on the 'Not My Dream House - Find Me Another!' button. This button will display a new home that also meets their requirements.
